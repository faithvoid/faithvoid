[Faith Void | 29 | she/ae]

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Faith, a freelance IT tech, open-source programmer, DJ, archivist, and musician from Canada. 

My main programming languages of choice are **Python**, **HTML** and **C++** and the systems I target are usually *nix-based & ARM-based systems such as the **Raspberry Pi**, and the **Nintendo Switch**, but I've been getting into original Xbox & RISC-V development recently!

If any of my Nintendo Switch ports stop working on newer firmwares, please open an issue and I'll recompile with the latest libNX!

### Mixxx Controller Mappings:
- **Hercules DJ 4Set** (~99%, last things to implement are spinback via Scratch button + keeping LED 1/3 on when looping under 1 beat or over 4 beats).
- **Novation Launchpad X** (mostly finished, just need to figure out if LED states and colours can be called via JS for more user customizability).
