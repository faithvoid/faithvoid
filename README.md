Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm faithvoid, a freelance IT tech, open-source programmer, DJ, archivist, and musician from Canada. 

My main programming languages of choice are **Python**, **HTML** and **C++** and the systems I target are usually *nix-based & ARM-based systems such as the **Raspberry Pi**, and the **Nintendo Switch**, but I've been getting into original Xbox & RISC-V development recently!

If any of my Nintendo Switch ports stop working on newer firmwares, please open an issue and I'll recompile with the latest libNX! Please note that my Switch ports are considered "deprecated" now, as I no longer own a Switch and have moved on to the Steam Deck.

### Mixxx Controller Mappings:
- **Hercules DJ 4Set** (~99%, last things to implement are spinback via Scratch button + keeping LED 1/3 on when looping under 1 beat or over 4 beats).
- **Novation Launchpad X** (mostly finished, just need to figure out if LED states and colours can be called via JS for more user customizability).
