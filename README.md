[Faith Void | 28 | she/ae]

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Faith, a freelance IT tech, open-source programmer, DJ, archivist, and musician from Canada. 

My main programming languages of choice are **Python**, **HTML** and **C++** and the systems I target are usually *nix-based & ARM-based systems such as the **Raspberry Pi**, and the **Nintendo Switch**, but I've been getting into original Xbox & RISC-V development recently!

If any of my Nintendo Switch ports stop working on newer firmwares, please open an issue and I'll recompile with the latest libNX!

[XBMC Addons](https://github.com/faithvoid/xbmc-addons)

## Currently working on:
### Xbox:
- [**Cortana**](https://github.com/faithvoid/skin.cortana) - Xbox Media Centre / XBMC4Xbox theme which integrates Insignia & XLink Kai server information, modernizations, match joining, and additional quality-of-life features (using Cortana Chat & Cortana Server Browser).
- [**Cortana Chat**](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanachat) - Xbox Media Centre / XBMC4Xbox script for 2-way IP-based instant messaging, with realtime notifications!
- [**Cortana Server Browser**](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanaserverbrowser) - Insignia & XLink Kai server browser / session notifier for Xbox Media Centre / XBMC4Xbox.
- [**Cortana Companion**](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanacompanion) - Script for XBMC4Xbox + Raspberry Pi to use the Raspberry Pi as a wireless "modchip-esque" display using a SH1106/SSD1306.
- [**Cortana Wireless**](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.cortanawireless) - Wireless adapter solution for the original Xbox using a Raspberry Pi and an ethernet adapter.
- [**HearThisAtX**](https://github.com/faithvoid/plugin.music.hearthisat) - HearThis.At plugin for Xbox Media Centre / XBMC4Xbox. (Functionally complete, needs a few QoL features).
- [**ScrobbleBox**](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.scrobblebox) - Offline Last.FM/Libre.FM scrobbler for XBMC.
- [**Alexandria**](https://github.com/faithvoid/script.alexandria) - Internet Archive downloader for XBMC.

### Other:
- [**Pastel97**](https://github.com/faithvoid/Pastel97) - Custom Redmond97 colour palettes for XFCE4!
- [**PiHOLED**](https://github.com/faithvoid/PiHOLED) (basic Python script to display Raspberry Pi, Network, PiHole and RetroPie statistics on SH1106-based 1.3 inch (128x64) OLED display HATs)
- [**MixxxUtilities**](https://github.com/faithvoid/MixxxUtilities) (Various scripts and programs for simplifying one's workflow in Mixxx.)
### Mixxx Controller Mappings:
- **Hercules DJ 4Set** (~99%, last things to implement are spinback via Scratch button + keeping LED 1/3 on when looping under 1 beat or over 4 beats).
- **Novation Launchpad X** (mostly finished, just need to figure out if LED states and colours can be called via JS for more user customizability).
