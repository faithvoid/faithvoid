Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Faith, a freelance IT tech, open-source programmer, DJ, and musician from Canada. 

My main programming languages of choice are **Python**, **HTML** and **C++** and the systems I target are usually ARM-based systems such as the **Raspberry Pi** and **Nintendo Switch**, but I've been getting into RISC-V development recently!

## Currently working on:
- PiHOLED (basic Python script to display Raspberry Pi, Network, PiHole and RetroPie statistics on SH1106-based 1.3 inch (128x64) OLED display HATs)
- MixxxUtilities (Various scripts and programs for simplifying one's workflow in Mixxx.)
- Hercules DJ 4Set DJ Controller mapping for Mixxx (~95%, need to implement light vs hard jog code and better loop in/out functionality).

If any of my Nintendo Switch ports stop working on newer firmwares, please open an issue and I'll recompile with the latest libNX!
