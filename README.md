Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm Faith, a freelance IT tech, open-source programmer, DJ, and musician from Canada. 

My main programming languages of choice are **Python**, **HTML** and **C++** and the systems I target are usually ARM-based systems such as the **Raspberry Pi**, **Nintendo Switch**, and as of recently, the **original Xbox**, but I've been getting into RISC-V development recently!

## Currently working on:
- **JX720 - Insignia Edition** - Xbox Media Centre / XBMC4Xbox theme which integrates Insignia information, modernizations and additional quality-of-life features.
- **HearThisAtX** - HearThis.At plugin for Xbox Media Centre / XBMC4Xbox.
- **PiHOLED** (basic Python script to display Raspberry Pi, Network, PiHole and RetroPie statistics on SH1106-based 1.3 inch (128x64) OLED display HATs)
- **MixxxUtilities** (Various scripts and programs for simplifying one's workflow in Mixxx.)

If any of my Nintendo Switch ports stop working on newer firmwares, please open an issue and I'll recompile with the latest libNX!

## Mixxx Controller Mappings:
- **Hercules DJ 4Set** (~99%, last things to implement are spinback via Scratch button + keeping LED 1/3 on when looping under 1 beat or over 4 beats).
- **Novation Launchpad X** (mostly finished, just need to figure out if LED states and colours can be called via JS for more user customizability).
